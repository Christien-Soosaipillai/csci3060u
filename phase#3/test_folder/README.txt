Tests were ran on Windows using GIT Bash Shell.
If you lack permission to run the EXE file, build and release TicketMachineFE
and copy the exe from the x64/Release/TicketMachineFE into each test folder
where scripts are located and then run script.

Navigate to each function test folder in GIT BASH Shell and then use the function command:
./test_everything

The actual output is sent to the output folder
and the expected_output folder is the folder with
the proposed output of the program.
